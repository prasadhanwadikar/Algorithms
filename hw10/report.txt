1. best
A: Time complexity: O(n^3)
   Space complexity: O(n^2)
   Algorithm: Top down as per recurance relation
          opt[i,j] = \oplus { \oplus_{i<k<=j} opt[i,k-1] \otimes opt[k,j] \otimes 1, opt[i+1, j] }
          Here, \oplus = max and \otimes = +

2. total
A: Time complexity: O(n^3)
   Space complexity: O(n^2)
   Algorithm: Top down as per recurance relation
          opt[i,j] = \oplus { \oplus_{i<k<=j} opt[i,k-1] \otimes opt[k,j] \otimes 1, opt[i+1, j] }
          Here, \oplus = + and \otimes = *

3. kbest
A: Time complexity: O(n^3 + n^2.k.logn))
   Space complexity: O(n^2.k)
   Algorithm: Naive approach: Derived all possible structures with # of pairs, then reversely sorted all structures, then picked first k items.
              Matrices approach: Build a list of tuples, with each tuple a pair of strings i.e. left and right part of s partitioned by l, for all values of l.
              Same list will have one tuple with only one string created other part of recurrance relation. Also push best elements for all these tuples of strings
              in a heap. Also keep track of positions which per tuple which gave kbest for that string. Pop from heap till k elements are gathered or all
              possible structures have been filled in result. After each pop from heap identify it is from which tuple of sub strings and compute next best
              structure for each of the sub string of pair by incrementing matrix pointers.
