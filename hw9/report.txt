1. Dijkstra
A: Time complexity: O((V+E)logV)
   Space complexity: O(V)

2. Traveling Salesman Problem
A: Sub problem:
   Recurrence Relation: OPT[S][i] =     min       OPT[S - {j}][j] + c(j,i)
                                    j in S - {i}
   Time complexity:
     Viterbi: O((2^V)V^2)
     Dijkstra: O((2^V)V^3)
   Space complexity: O((2^V)V)
