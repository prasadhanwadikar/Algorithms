0: Is Fibonacci REALLY O(n)?
A: Yes as f(n) gets calculated only once for each value of n from 1 to n.

1: What's the complexity MIS problem?
A: O(n) as maximum sum and max independent set gets calculated only once for each value of length from 1 to n.

2: Number of BSTs - What's the complexity of this DP? What's the name of this famous number series?
A: O(n) as number of BSTs per value of n (1 to n) gets calculated only once. Name of number series is Catalan number series.
